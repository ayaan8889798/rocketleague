<h1>RACE AGAINST THE MACHINE</h1><p>One of the most recognizable silhouettes in sports car history is coming to Rocket League: the Porsche 911 Turbo. This high-class powerhouse has both the style and the speed needed to create a legendary name for itself. Porsche celebrates their 75th anniversary this year, and the 911 is a timeless example of the automaker’s beloved designs.
  You’ll instantly unlock the in-game Porsche 911 Turbo when you purchase Rocket Pass Premium, but once you’ve tiered up a little, you’ll also earn a version that can only be described as a wild, wide-bodied beast. The Porsche 911 Turbo RLE boasts super-sized fenders, an eye-catching lip splitter, and a stylish LED car logo on the rear. Even the turbo’s famous tea tray spoiler receives a mammoth upgrade! Whichever ride you choose, both cars use the Dominus Hitbox and will keep you cruising with a high-speed connection. </p>
